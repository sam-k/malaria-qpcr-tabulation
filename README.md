# malaria-qpcr-tabulation
Preliminary tabulation of real-time PCR data for malarial mosquitoes.

Part of the [Spatial R21 project](https://sites.duke.edu/taylorlab/projects/#MolEpi), which investigates the molecular epidemiology of *P. falciparum* transmission in Western Kenya.

## Preliminary tabulation
- Tabulate qPCR data by presence in heads/abdomens of mosquitoes and by prevalence across villages.
- Compare Pfr364 Ct values between replicates for use in censoring rules.
